# Hedge_Bot

This is HedgeBot

HedgeBot posts pictures of hedges (or any pictures) on your profile, tagging friends and posting inspiration quotes and such

To sort out all the authentication keys and such, run with the -c argument
Only posts 1 picture and quote to all friends in the config file each run, I recommend setting this up with crontab for daily use
